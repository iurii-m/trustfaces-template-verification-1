## Dataset
The origin of the dataset is

pics.stir.ac.uk.

The subset of the images from this dataset was printed, captured by smartphone and rectified automatically.

The print capture datasets are available by the link to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sFuBNWE5nKYvRgcFhB2pC1DcYnpCTHfe?usp=sharing).


## Code for the template extracting
Allows to extract in-house facial biomertic template from the image.
